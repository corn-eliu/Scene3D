A simple tool for finding camera extrinsics given the intrinsics and 4 points on the ground plane. Simple geometry can also be defined very easily and objects tracked in time using Nuke can be added to the scene. It spits out the data structures that I use for my PhD but feel free to hack to spit out the gl camera representation (projection and view matrices) and/or the scene geometry as a mesh.

It's written in python and uses pySide for the UI. I suggest using Anaconda to install the needed dependencies.
